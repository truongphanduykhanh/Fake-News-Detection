*The Goal this project is to detect if a news is fake based on its contents and network situation*

* There are following components in this folder:

Folder "fake-news-prediction-toulouse": 	Raw data
Folder "Submission": 						All submitted versions on Kaggle
Folder "Temporary_Files":					Intermediate pickle files - parts of notebook execution
File "Python_Code.ipynb":					Notebook file (Python)
File "README.md":							Instruction of running the project


* All you need to do is open "Python_Code.ipynb" by a web browser and execute all the cells.
* All neccessary input files are liked to "fake-news-prediction-toulouse" and "Submission" already.
