Trump Jr. defends Skittles tweet: 'I don't deal in microaggression'

Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was "trying to point out things that have to be said."
Story highlights The tweet took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week

"We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space," Trump said

Boise, Idaho (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was "trying to point out things that have to be said."

"People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist," Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. "For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for."

The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: "If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem." -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it "disgusting" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.

But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.

Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, "Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy."
